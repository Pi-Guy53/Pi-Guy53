## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Pi-guy53 (older username) or more recently UsrnGamesInc. I also sometimes respond to Jimmy :wink: (long story)

I am a student Game Developer working towards my assosicates at :black_large_square::black_large_square::black_large_square::black_large_square:. I have also recently ended up double majoring as an Interface and Web developer. 

I enjoy coding, World building, Dnd, and Warhammer 40k (both painting and playing). 
In between my school projects I have a number of side projects, including an FPS, Horror game, and a space combat simulator. As I get time I try to continue these, though when school is in session my chances to do so are much lower :pensive:

I when I remember I like to try to post my games/demos onto my [Itch account](https://i-need-a-usrn.itch.io). So far everything on my Itch is free, and playable in browser. However due to server constraints, I may have to start posting Windows/Mac specific builds rather than Browser Playables.

Naturally once I manage to make a full game that I am happy with, I hope to start to make a profit off of it. 

I use mostly Unity with C#, and enjoy 3D modeling :trident:
and I am really into Procedural Generation

I've also been playing around with rendered scenes here are two, the top one is from 2020, and the bottom one is from 2022. Despite their similarities, all the assests were completly remade.
