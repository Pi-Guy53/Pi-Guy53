## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Pi-guy53 (older username) or more recently [@UsrnGamesInc](https://twitter.com/IncUsrn) on twitter (I'm terrible at posting). I also sometimes respond to Jimmy :wink: (long story)

I am a student Game Developer working towards my assosicates at The :black_large_square::black_large_square::black_large_square::black_large_square: I enjoy codding, and in between my school projects I have a number of side projects, including an FPS, Horror game, and a space combat simulator. 

I when I remeber I like to try to post my games/demos onto my [Itch account](https://i-need-a-usrn.itch.io). So far everything on my Itch is free, and playable in browser. However due to server constraints, I may have to start posting Windows/Mac specific builds rather than Browser Playables.

Naturally once I manage to make a full game that I am happy with, I hope to start to make a profit off of it. 

I use mostly Unity with C#, and enjoy 3D modeling :trident:
and I am really into Procedural Generation
